As each child arrives, observe him/her for injuries, sores, rash, coughing, wheezing, runny eyes or nose or other complaints of discomfort from the child.  If you notice anything signific
ant, check with the child &/or parents about the circumstances and report it to the Director, if necessary.  Injuries should be noted on the health incident report form.
\par 
\par }{\f2\ul ILLNESS}{\f2 
\par \tab If a child becomes ill, have him/her see the Director.  Illness would include headache, stomachache, rash, fever, sore throat, or any other symptom of pain or discomfort.  The Director will take the child\rquote 
s temperature, if necessary, and call the parents to make arrangements for the child's care.  The child should be made comforta
ble while they wait in a separate area (but within sight and sound of an adult) until the parent arrives.  Details about each Incident should be recorded on a Health Incident Form, which the parent should sign upon arrival.
\par 
\par }{\f2\ul INJURIES}{\f2 
\par \tab Injuries that need tr
eatment with the first aid supplies should be recorded in the medical logbook.  Ice is available in the freezer.  Minor incidents like scrapes and bruises should be reported to the parent when the child is picked up.  Anything more serious or questionable
 should be reported to the parent, immediately, by phone, so they can decide whether any further action is desired for the child.
\par \tab If there is }{\b\f2 any}{\f2  chance that the child may have a head, neck or back injury or a broken bone, do NOT move them.  Stay with them
 while someone else calls 911 for an ambulance, and then notify the parent, as soon as possible, then the Director.
\par \tab If a child hits his/her head, even if it is just a bump that needs ice, notify the parent and let the parent decide whether to have the child examined.  The same procedure applies for a cut that looks like it may need stitches.
\par \tab Make a note of each step that you followed on the Medical Incident Form. 
\par 
\par }{\f2\ul MEDICATION}{\f2 
\par \tab If a child is found to have any kind of pills, capsules, or liquid medicine, it
 should be locked in the medicine box and the Director should be notified.  The Director will review the medication policy with the parents.  No staff person should administer medication, including aspirin, cough drops, etc. to any child.  The Director wi
ll administer prescription medication only if needed during the afterschool time and only with the required information provided by the parents.
\par 
\par }{\f2\ul SAFETY PRECAUTIONS}{\f2 
\par \tab Students should not be allowed to run in halls or play with, or around, the doors.  Check t
he floors frequently for game pieces, papers, pencils or wet spots that could cause falls.  Halls and doorways must be kept clear for easy exit in case of emergency.  Do not let students engage in play that could result in eye injury, eg.- throwing pencil
s or playing with pencils in hand, throwing or poking with game pieces, blocks, sticks, stones, etc.
\par \tab Students may be allowed a few minutes to use the bathroom.  If they do not return promptly, check on them.  They should not be allowed to play in the bathr
ooms.  If a student does not follow these guidelines, he/she should be accompanied by another, responsible, student or an adult. 
\par 
\par }{\f2\ul SECURITY}{\f2 
\par \tab The outside doors should be kept locked.  Only students enrolled in the program, and their parents, should be admit
ted to the building.  Do not allow the children to open the door unless they know the child or parent who is outside of it.  Do not allow anyone else in the building besides participants in the program.  Do not make exceptions for neighbors to use the wat
e
r fountains, bathrooms, etc.  Children should not be outside unless an adult is within sight and sound in case they need any assistance.  Do not accept any students in the program unless all registration forms have been completed, especially the emergency
 card.
\par 
\par }{\f2\ul SPORTS}{\f2 
\par \tab There should be 'no contact' with the lacrosse sticks, since the students do not wear protective gear.  That means }{\b\f2 no}{\f2 
 stick checking.  Football should be "touch" only, for the same reason.  When using tennis racquets and bats, make sure ther
e is sufficient clearance between players, to prevent injuries.  Hockey sticks may only be used if students are consistent about keeping them on the ground/floor.  (Any swings above the knee are an automatic penalty.)
\par 
\par }{\f2\ul OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES}{\f2 
\par \tab Check the play ar
ea for glass or sharp objects that must be cleared before any activity begins.  Students should not be allowed to take jump ropes on any climbing or swinging equipment.  Do not allow scarves or loose jacket strings when students are climbing, swinging or 
sliding on the playground.  Remind students to keep shoelaces tied.  Rough housing, wrestling and karate are not allowed, since these often result in injuries and/or conflicts.  No one is allowed to walk or slide on icy areas.
\par 
\par }{\f2\ul BEE STINGS}{\f2 
\par \tab Remove the stinge
r, if necessary, by scraping with a fingernail.  Apply ice if the child wishes.  Ask the child when he/she was last stung and whether there was any reaction other than local swelling.  Also check the child's card for any notation of allergic reaction.  Ke
ep a close eye on the child for unusual swelling, hives, rash or difficulty breathing.  If these occur, call the parent &/or 911 (depending on the severity).  Even if there is no reaction to the sting, still notify the parents when the child is picked up.

\par 
\par }{\f2\ul FIRE}{\f2 
\par \tab In case of fire (or a fire drill), make sure all students walk quickly out of the building and go to the meeting area.  Take the attendance list, and emergency cards, ensuring that all students are accounted for.  If the building is made inaccessible
, go to the nearest public building for shelter and call parents for prompt pick-up.
\par 
\par }{\f2\ul MEDICAL EMERGENCIES}{\f2 
\par \tab Call 911.  Tell them the child's approximate age and what happened.  Tell them which building entrance to use.  Stay on the line until they tell you 
to hang up.  Have someone wait at the door to direct the emergency personnel.  Call the child's parent.  Notify the site Director, who will notify the Executive Director.  Write down the details on the Medical Incident Form after the student's needs are m
et.
\par \tab If you are not sure whether immediate treatment is necessary, check with the Director, the parent, the child's pediatrician, or our consulting pediatrician, Dr. Michael Sherlock, 1205 York Road, 410-321-8822.
